Santino Rice,,,"""I think with the dress, it starts to fall apart after the bust line. The left and the right look like different shapes.""",,,,

Alaska,,,"""Thank you.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""Why no earrings?""",,,,
Alaska,,,"""I lost them in the dumpster.""",,,,
Camille Grammar,,,"""I like the way you have accessorized it. I don't think you need anything more, 'cause you've got a lot of shimmer going on because of the plastic Saran Wrap.""",,,,

Serena ChaCha,,,"""Hola.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""I had a little bit of an issue with what you're wearing, I'm not gonna lie.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""The shape is all wrong for you, you're gonna get lost in it. And then what's exposed just looks like boy.""",,,,
Santino Rice,,52:18:00,"""It looks like you've done your makeup in a lighter shade than your body. And it almost looks like if you pulled the head off of one doll and, like, put it onto the body of, like, a G.I. Joe figure. And this collar really adds this big weight around your neck that separates your head from your body.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Can I see it without the neck thing?""",,,,
Camille Grammar,,,"""It looks so much prettier.""",,,,
Serena ChaCha,,,"""I just wanna say I'm open to all of the criticism, and I'm making sure to put it to the next challenge, whatever it may be.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Alright, well, thank you. Well, ladies, I think we've heard enough. While you enjoy an Absolut cocktail in the Interior Illusions Lounge, the judges and I will deliberate. You may leave the stage.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Alright kids. Just between us ""goils..."" let's start with... Roxxxy Andrews.""",,,,
Santino Rice,,,"""Roxxxy had a very convincing red carpet couture look and a great blend of fabrics and unconventional materials.""",,,,
Camille Grammar,,,"""She combined goth with glam and I thought she looked great.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""Completely thought out. Like, she knows what her shape is all about.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""I do have a con with Roxxxy Andrews. I wanted to see more ass.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""Hahahaha""",,,,
,,,"""Ivy Winters!""",,,,
,,,"""I mean, the dress was beautiful. But I really couldn't stop looking at her hair. I just didn't like it, 'cause this dress was so 'elogent'.""",,,,

Santino Rice,,,"""As beautiful as that dress was, where's the trash? I didn't get that same kind of feeling when I look at Alaska, or Lineysha.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""Lineysha was 'eloguent'.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Alright, let's move on to Jade Jolie. My goodness, Jade Jolie. She had a lot on.""",,,,
Santino Rice,,,"""I can't really tell where her taste level is because--""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""I think you can. I think you can.""",,,,
Mike Ruiz,,,"""She has a very fantastical sort of outlook on life about rainbows and unicorns and all. But, I just don't think it was very well-executed.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Let's talk about Penny. Tration.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""She came out with a great attitude. I get the whole Mae West kinda, 'come up and see me sometime' thing going on. But then you kinda scroll down a little bit.""",,,,
Mike Ruiz,,,"""The padding was asymmetrical. It looked like she had a tilted pelvis. Somebody call the osteopath or something.""",,,,
Santino Rice,,,"""Make a silhouette and perfect it. Is that too much to ask?""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Hello. It is not. You could be a big girl, make those proportions work for you and actually look couture. And she didn't.""",,,,
Camille Grammar,,,"""Yeah, but it was the makeup for me. It was just awful.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""That was probably the best part, Camille.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Alright, let's head on to the 49th state, Alaska.""",,,,
Mike Ruiz,,,"""I wasn't really expecting much from Alaska, based on her performance in the photoshoot, but a little Saran Wrap went a long way tonight. The only thing is, it should've had a little slit, 'cause she had a little difficulty walking tonight.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""My one thing was, I would've loved to have seen some sparkling earrings up on that.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Well, Michelle, Alaska's not from New Jersey.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""Hahahaha""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Alright, let's move on to Lineysha Sparx.""",,,,
,,,"""What a gorgeous face on this one.""",,,,
,,,"""Yes.""",,,,
,,,"""The gown was absolutely gorgeous.""",,,,
,,,"""And when we found out that it was actually wallpaper, I was even more impressed.""",,,,
,,,"""And to put a shoe, a pump, in her hair, I thought that was really fun and whimsical.""",,,,
,,,"""You're right, and it could've very easily been a disaster.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""But all in all, she's what we call a TP.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""A total package, that's right.""",,,,
RuPaul,,,"""Let's talk ChaCha, as in Serena ChaCha.""",,,,
Michelle Visage,,,"""Oh God, she was literally drag Pinocchio. It was lederhosen. It was really like I was waiting for yodeling. It was really just a mess.""",,,,
Santino Rice,,,"""She was showing so much of this like, oiled-up chest.""",,,,
Camille Grammar,,,"""And it was like a little boy with a costume on.""",,,,
,,,"""I think that she has to start thinking about her tiny little body and the way she's gonna execute her fashions.""",,,,
